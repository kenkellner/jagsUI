Changes in version 1.4.9 (2017-12-08)

 * Fix bug with DIC output introduced in 1.4.7.

 * Allow turning deviance/DIC monitoring on/off when updating an existing model. Overhaul handling of adaptation; default to running a sequence of adapt() calls until JAGS reports adapation is adequate. Suggest minimum of 1000 adaptation iterations otherwise in man pages. Change output of summary function. Add ability to control factories.

Changes in version 1.4.4 (2018-11-10)

 * Fix to allow running in parallel when dependencies are in non-standard libraries. Fix bug when updating jagsbasic class.

Changes in version 1.4.2 (2016-02-21)

 * Changes to NAMESPACE to get clean build check on R-devel.

Changes in version 1.4.1 (2016-02-20)

 * Add ability to specify number of CPU cores to use when running in parallel.

Changes in version 1.4.0 (2016-02-10)

 * Fix a problem where saving output for a single scalar parameter broke output processing.

Changes in version 1.3.9 (2016-01-21)

 * Fix a problem where nonscalar estimated parameters with missing (i.e., non-estimated) values broke the display of summary stats.

Changes in version 1.3.8 (2015-07-13)

 * Explicitly import functions from default packages to meet new standards for building with R-devel. Change minimum required version of rjags to 3-13.

Changes in version 1.3.7 (2015-06-11)

 * Add verbose argument to functions to allow suppression of all text output in the console as the function runs.

Changes in version 1.3.6 (2015-05-06)

 * Change method for closing connection to clusters when running in parallel to avoid closing unrelated connections. Adjust output for jags.basic.

Changes in version 1.3.5 (2015-03-26)

 * Fix problem with max.iter argument in autojags(). Clarify documentation and output for autojags().

Changes in version 1.3.4 (2015-03-21)

 * Add option save.all.iter in autojags() function to combine MCMC samples from all iterative updates into final posterior.

Changes in version 1.3.3 (2015-02-24)

 * Fix issue with calculating stats that sometimes occurred with a constant posterior distribution.

Changes in version 1.3.2 (2015-01-29)

 * Fix error where autojags did not handle NA rhat values properly. Added more helpful warning when at least one rhat value = NA.

Changes in version 1.3.1 (2015-01-15)

 * Minor wording changes.

Changes in version 1.3 (2014-12-01)

 * Add warning and fix issue with traceplot when number of saved iterations after thinning was rounded up by JAGS (because it wasn't an integer). Several small fixes to clean up code and get R CMD check to run cleanly.

Changes in version 1.2 (2014-11-19)

 * Add some failsafes/warnings.

Changes in version 1.1 (2014-07-28)

 * Clean up / modularize code. Add an auto-updating function autojags(). Several small bugfixes.

Changes in version 1.00 (2014-05-21)

 * Update to new package name ('jagsUI'). Implement update function. Bugfixes. Final release prior to CRAN upload.

Changes in version 0.01-7 (2014-05-12)

 * Fix setting the random seed so it actually works. Allow running MCMC chains in parallel. Various bugfixes.

Changes in version 0.01-6 (2014-05-09)

 * Overhaul calculation of statistics to speed things up. Minor bugfixes.

Changes in version 0.01-5 (2014-05-06)

 * Bugfixes. Changed primary function name to 'jags' from 'simplejags' for simplicity. Also edited several other function names. Added a summary table to the output object.

Changes in version 0.01-3 (2014-04-17)

 * Simplify output object so that indexed parameters are contained in their own array rather than many separate list objects. Adjust other functions to match this change. Clean up the printed text / progress bars in R console.

Changes in version 0.01-2 (2014-04-08)

 * Fix problem where some components of output object were vectors instead of lists (and change print function accordingly). Add option for simplejags() to save input data and initial values in model output object for future use (store.data).
